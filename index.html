							<h3>Hello!</h3>
							<p><strong>Research.</strong><br />
							My research explores the dynamical evolution of globular clusters, with much of my work focused on the role of multiple stellar populations. I use Monte Carlo simulations to study how binaries, mass segregation, and stellar evolution shape the radial structure and long-term evolution of clusters, including the development of features such as bimodal binary fractions and changes in the stellar mass function. In addition, I work with observational data from both space- and ground-based facilities to connect theoretical predictions with the spatial distributions and kinematics of stars in Milky Way globular clusters and satellite systems.</p>
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>I am currently a PhD student in Astronomy at Indiana University Bloomington, where I am also completing a minor in Scientific Computing. I previously earned an Honours B.Sc. Specialist degree in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Toronto, followed by a post-baccalaureate research appointment, during which I worked on spectroscopic studies of Milky Way satellites and the development of data-analysis pipelines for multi-object spectrographs. My training combines theoretical stellar dynamics, numerical methods, and observational astronomy.</p>
							<p>Outside of research, I enjoy reading, watching television, and spending time hiking with my dog Harvey.</p>

								<h3>Exploring the Dynamical Evolution of Binary Stars in Multiple-Population Globular Clusters</h3>
							<p>The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. In this study, we use a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explore how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results showcase how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience enhanced rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigate the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we study main sequence-white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster initial conditions and dynamical evolution.</p>

							<p><i>Milone, A.P., Marino, A.F. and 26 others (including Bruce, J.)</i></p>
						<p>Almost all globular clusters (GCs) contain multiple stellar populations consisting of stars with varying helium and light-element abundances. These populations include first-population stars, which exhibit similar chemical compositions as halo-field stars with comparable [Fe/H], and second-population stars, characterized by higher helium and nitrogen abundances along with reduced levels of oxygen and carbon. Nowadays, one of the most intriguing open questions about GCs pertains to the formation and evolution of their multiple populations. Recent works based on N-body simulations of GCs show that the fractions and characteristics of binary stars can serve as dynamic indicators of the formation period of multiple-population GCs and their subsequent dynamical evolution. Nevertheless, the incidence of binaries among multiple populations is still poorly studied. Moreover, the few available observational studies focus only on the bright stars of a few GCs. We used deep images of the GC 47 Tucanae collected with the James Webb and the Hubble space telescopes to investigate the incidence of binaries among multiple populations of M dwarfs and bright main-sequence stars. To reach this objective, we used UV, optical, and near-infrared filters to construct photometric diagrams that allowed us to disentangle binary systems and multiple populations. Moreover, we compared these observations with a large sample of simulated binaries. In the cluster central regions, the incidence of binaries among first-population stars is only slightly higher than that of second-population stars. In contrast, in the external regions, the majority of the studied binaries (≳85%) are composed of first-population stars. These results are consistent with the GC formation scenarios in which the second-population stars originate in the cluster's central region, forming a compact and dense stellar group within a more extended system of first-population stars.</p>

						<h3><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...696A.220B/abstract" target="_blank">Exploring the formation environment and dynamics of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters through binary systems</a></h3>
						<p><i>Bortolan, E., Bruce, J., et al.</i></p>
						<p>Aims. Globular clusters (GCs) are known to host distinct stellar populations, characterized by different chemical compositions. Despite extensive research, the origin of these populations remains elusive. According to many formation scenarios, the second population (2P) originated within a compact and denser region embedded in a more extended first population (1P) system. As a result, 2P binaries should be disrupted at a larger rate than 1P binaries. For this reason, binary systems offer valuable insight into the environments in which these stellar populations formed and evolved. Methods. We analyzed the fraction of binaries among 1P and 2P M dwarfs in the outer region of NGC 288 using Hubble Space Telescope data. We combined our results with those from a previous work, where we inferred the fraction of 1P and 2P binaries in the cluster center. Results. In the outer region, we find a predominance of 1P binaries (97<sup>+1</sup><sub>-3</sub>%) compared to 2P binaries (3 ± 1%) corresponding to an incidence of binaries with a mass ratio (i.e., the ratio between the masses of the primary and secondary star) greater than 0.5 equal to 6.4 ± 1.7% for the 1P and 0.3 ± 0.2% for the 2P. These binary fractions and incidences differ from those found in the cluster's central region, where the 1P and 2P exhibit similar binary incidences and fractions. These results are in general agreement with the predictions of simulations following the evolution of binary stars in multiple-population GCs, starting with a dense 2P subsystem concentrated in the central regions of a 1P system.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...950..167B/abstract" target="_blank">Spectroscopic Analysis of Milky Way Outer Halo Satellites: Aquarius II and Boötes II</a></h3>
					<p><i>Bruce, J., Li, T. S., et al.</i></p>
					<p>In this paper, we present a chemical and kinematic analysis of two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), Aquarius II (Aqu II) and Boötes II (Boo II), using Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy. We present the largest sample of member stars for Boo II (12), and the largest sample of red giant branch members with metallicity measurements for Aqu II (eight). In both UFDs, over 80% of targets selected based on Gaia proper motions turned out to be spectroscopic members. In order to maximize the accuracy of stellar kinematic measurements, we remove the identified binary stars and RR Lyrae variables. For Aqu II, we measure a systemic velocity of -65.3 ± 1.8 km s<sup>-1</sup> and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −2.57<sup>+0.17</sup><sub>−0.17</sub>. When compared with previous measurements, these values display a ~6 km s<sup>-1</sup> difference in radial velocity and a decrease of 0.27 dex in metallicity. Similarly for Boo II, we measure a systemic velocity of −130.4<sup>+1.4</sup><sub>−1.1</sub> km s<sup>-1</sup>, more than 10 km s<sup>-1</sup> different from the literature, a metallicity almost 1 dex smaller at [Fe/H] = −2.71<sup>+0.11</sup><sub>−0.10</sub>, and a velocity dispersion 3 times smaller at σ<sub>vhel</sub>=2.9<sup>+1.6</sup><sub>−1.2</sub> km s<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, we derive systemic proper-motion parameters and model the orbits of both UFDs. Finally, we highlight the extremely dark-matter-dominated nature of Aqu II and compute the J-factor for both galaxies to aid searches of dark matter annihilation. Despite the small size and close proximity of Boo II, it is an intermediate target for the indirect detection of dark matter annihilation due to its low-velocity dispersion and corresponding low dark matter density.</p>
